This is a merge sort algorithm for The Odin Project's [Recursion lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion).

It's able to sort an array of numbers. This array may contain duplicate numbers and its length may be even or odd.

Usage: `mergeSort(yourArray)`.

Example: `mergeSort([4, -2, 1]) // [-2, 1, 4]`

It will detect and discard non-arrays and empty arrays, but it will not detect incorrectly formatted arrays.

The script contains 13 example arrays. You can run the script as-is and it will print their results.
